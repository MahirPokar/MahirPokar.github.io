  - title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
    authors: <strong>Mahir Pokar</strong>
    conference_short: Reinforcement Learning 
    conference: This project explores the paradigm of multi-agent reinforcement learning, particularly in cooperative environments. The sequential decision problem is modelled as a Markov decision process, and then an optimal policy is found using the temporal difference learning algorithm; Q-learning. Through this project, the challenges posed by MARLs non-stationarity, particularly the adaptation of learning agents to evolving policies of other agents is explored.
