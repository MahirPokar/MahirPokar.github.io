  - title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
    authors: <strong>Mahir Pokar</strong>
    conference_short: Reinforcement Learning 
    conference: This project explores the paradigm of multi-agent reinforcement learning, particularly in cooperative environments. The sequential decision problem is modelled as a Markov decision process, and then an optimal policy is found using the temporal difference learning algorithm; Q-learning. Through this project, the challenges posed by MARLs non-stationarity, particularly the adaptation of learning agents to evolving policies of other agents is explored.

  - title: Control of wheeled robots 
    authors: <strong>Mahir Pokar</strong>
    conference_short: Robotics 
    conference: This video explores the performance of a robot through the implementation of closed-loop motion control using MATLAB and Simulink. It walks through key tasks involved in characterizing the robots behavior, analyzing the results, and interpreting the performance outcomes in a clear and effective way. The focus is on understanding how control systems affect robotic motion and how to communicate these findings.

  - title: Line Following Buggy
    authors: <strong>Mahir Pokar</strong>
    conference_short: Embedded Systems 
    conference: In this second year group project we were tasked with making a line following buggy. As the team leader I managed the project ensuring we meet deadlines. As the control lead, I implemented a PID controller for the buggy, using an STM32 microcontroller. I also designed the sensor board on altium.
